# Exploratory Data Analysis SQL
---
### 1. Introduction:
SQL is indispensable for extracting critical information and performing data analysis for both for-profit and non-profit organizations. This project vividly illustrates my adeptness in utilizing SQL within MySQL Workbench to craft schemas, formulate queries, and merge tables for in-depth analysis of sales performance, consumer behavior, and market trends.

### 2. Schema (Tables):
There are six (6) tables used in the databases, namely:
- Customers
- Products
- Sales
- Stores
- Teams
- Regions

Except for the regions table, all are connected to the sales (child) table through foreign keys. A database called ‘product_sale’ is created to host the tables.


### 3 The Entity Relation Diagram (ERD)

Showing an ERD to end-users is helpful for them to visualize how tables are related to one another. It also reflects the cardinality between the parent tables and child tables by connecting foreign keys and primary keys respectively.
