# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_SQL
---
### 1. Introduction:
SQL is indispensable for extracting critical information and performing data analysis for both for-profit and non-profit organizations. This project vividly illustrates my adeptness in utilizing SQL within MySQL Workbench to craft schemas, formulate queries, and merge tables for in-depth analysis of sales performance, consumer behavior, and market trends.

### 2. Schema (Tables):
There are six (6) tables used in the databases, namely:
- Customers
- Products
- Sales
- Stores
- Teams
- Regions

Except for the regions table, all are connected to the sales (child) table through foreign keys. A database called ‘product_sale’ is created to host the tables.
